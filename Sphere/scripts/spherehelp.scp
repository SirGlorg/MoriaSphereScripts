[HELP FAQ 1]
OK I've got the files, now what?
.line
Configure your server correctly:
.line
1. In the SPHERE.ini file, see that each server listed has three lines of entry: Name, IP address, port. Server administrators must add their shard to the top of the shard list in the .ini file, or delete all others and leave their own shard listed only. List the name of your shard, and set the IP address of the server.
.line
2.  In the [SPHERE] section of SPHERE.ini list the directory where your client files are loaded under the Files= key.  There are several data files supplied on the game client CD required by the server.   We do not distribute these files.  If a SPHERE Administrator intends to run a client on the same machine as SPHERE server, we recommend installing the client to two different directories, so that one may be used exclusively by the server for speed's sake.  Provided the Administrator has lots of RAM, this is an ideal configuration.
.line
3.  FOR WIN32 PLATFORMS: Run SPHEREsvr.exe.  The shard console will appear in a DOS box window (as it is a 32 bit console application). It will now listen on port 2593 of any Internet connections that you may open. (assume x.x.x.x above) If the server is on a LAN it is assumed there is always an open Internet connection. If the server is run on a dial up Internet connection, then it will listen as soon as the machine is connected to the Internet.
.line
FOR UNIX/LINUX BASED PLATFORMS: (see documentation on www.sphereserver.com)
.line
4.  Add clients to the SPHEREacct.scp file.  The Server Administrator should add himself first -- usually this account is defaulted to "Administrator".  Make a unique password under this account listing.   There are additional privledge settings for players, including Game Master accounts, Counselor accounts, and regular player accounts. The first account in the [ACCOUNTS] section is named "Administrator" and will always have Administrator level clearance. The Administrator account is similar in powers to the Game Master level priv, however the server recognizes that the Game Master setting is of "lesser" standing in server heirarchy and will limit GM powers as applied to an Administrator. (i.e. GMs can kill GMs, but not the Administrator.)  Additionally, the Administrator may use the .setpriv command in game to make other accounts GMs without opening the account file. Read the documentation for a specific listing of these priv levels and settings.  Unlike other files included with SPHERE, the account file may be accessed, changed and saved while the server is running. For a list of console commands, press ? in the DOS cosole of the server for a list.    For a list of commands by priveledge, see the Documentation.

[HELP FAQ 2]
What do my Players need to know about logging on to the server?
.line
Every client that wishes to play on SPHERE must edit the login.cfg file in their game client directory.  We recommend advising your players to save a backup of this file, since once it is changed users cannot log into other game servers unless they revert to their original login.cfg file.
.line
Before attempting to connect to a new shard, the players must change each line in the login.cfg.  For example:
.line
"LoginServer=207.239.134.124,7775"
.line

Additionally, to run the client to connect with SPHERE Server, players must no use the default shortcut to Ultima Online -- instead, run the client.exe file located in the UO directory.  If users prefer they can make a Shortcut to refer to the client.exe instead.

[HELP FAQ 3]
How Many Players Can I Host?
.line
Hardware requirements are partially based on the size of the SPHERE you wish to
create.  A plain worldfile with extremely minimal  decoration (eg. just doors and signs
on static buildings) and few NPCs (Total 1500 or less including monster and animal
spawns) may be run on a Pentium II with 64 megs of ram and 10 megs of hard drive
space.  This is the absolute minimal system required to run the software with a
small worldfile and a few players.

[HELP FAQ 4]
My users get a "Having trouble connecting to Origin" Error Message. Why?
.line
The normal cause for this is a new or different encryption code between the server and client. Be sure the Server and Players have the CURRENT versions of the UO client.   To update a client, users must run autopatch.exe in their UO directory.  Only the latest alpha versions of SPHERE  server support the latest client.

My World is Empty! I see buildings, but no NPCs, no Doors, no Decorations -- Nothing!
.line
Be sure that your Worldfile (SPHEREworld.scp) is properly referred to in the SPHERE.ini file.   If your worldfile is appropriately referenced, then the problem may be that you are using a blank world.  Not all worldfiles come with NPCs already placed.  Most Shard Administrators prefer to place their own monster spawns, animals spawns and individual human NPCs.  SPHERE  Server Hand of God Tool will soon be released to make the worldbuilding process and quest administraton process easier.  Until that time, refer to the documentation or type .menu to add items and NPCs.

How do GM's broadcast commands?
.line
From the client side: Just (press ! then space ) Yell: if you are a GM. This broadcasts what the GM says, shard wide. From the DOS server console: Press ESC to toggle in and out of Broadcast mode.   Note: In this mode, text is not echoed back until you hit ENTER.


[HELP FAQ 9]
I am GM in this world and can't summon creatures or NPC's. The spell fizzles.
.line
Sometimes for quest purposes, GMs type .gm to hide their GM title.  Be sure that you are on GM Mode and are showing your GM title, otherwise GM functions like adding NPCs and items may not work properly.  Also, some "zoning" disallows magic.   Check with your server administrator to be sure you are not in an anti-magic zone.   If you have a particularly low magery skill, your spells have a greater chance to fizzle.

Are there ways to raise skills so one doesn't have to start out as a newbie? I've .tweaked the stats but I can't find any reference to changing skills.

[HELP FAQ 13]
How do I make houses and ships ?
.line
Many vendors sell house and ship deeds, but look in the defs file for the individual definitions of these items.  For example if you wish to make a Green Tent Deed, look in SPHEREdefs.scp for House_Template.  A Green Tent deed is number 04214.  Any number in the DEFS file which starts with a 0 indicates that unlike the rest of the file, that number is in HEX.  Simply type .add house_template_7 to add your green tent deed, or type .add 4214 Either will add a Green Tent Deed.  These kinds of funtions are MUCH easier with SPHERE Server Hand of God Tool.  To change the properties of the ships (Refer to the item listed in the MORE=number of each deed) to include ATTR=20 (a flying ship) or COLOR=XXXX to add color.  You can also change these properties in game with the following commands:
 .SET ATTR 020 Set it to magical type. (Magic ships can use the 'up', 'down' and 'land' commands)
 .SET COLOR x Set the deed/ship plans to another color to effect the end product.

[HELP FAQ 15]
I tried to control a monster and the client crashed / my server wouldn't save.
.line
The probable cause is the monster couldn't wear a death shroud. This should be fixed in a future release.  The .control command is unstable -- use it sparingly.  For example, if you decide to .control (jumpinto ) a monster, your original character will take on the properties of the monster itself, while your character's properties and behaviors are transferred to the monster body.  For example, you are a tailor and jump into an Orc with .control.  The human tailor body will wander off behaving like an Orc, and you will now be in an Orc body.  This is a dangerous command as you MUST be BACK in your ORIGINAL body by the time the next save occurs or your worldfile may become corrupt.  Remember -- your original body will NOT stay put unless you use .set flags 4 to paralyze it.  If you lose your original body, your worldfile cannot save and you'll have to revert.

[HELP FAQ 17]
Is there a way to set if a place should have dungeon lighting or daylight and a way to set the light levels of both of these lights. At the moment I think Dungeon light is too bright, and I want certain dungeons that is darker than others.
.line
Currently the dungeon light is set to 15 on a scale of 0-19. The light level for a sector (32x32 area) is saved at whatever you set it to with the .LIGHT x command. Use the .LIGHT 0 command to allow the light level to go back to it's default. The default is either the dungeon light level or the daylight level depending on time of day. The default dungeon light level can be set by the server admin in the SPHERE.ini file by setting DUNGEONLIGHT=15 or some other appropriate number.

[HELP FAQ 18]
Can I generate random creature spawns (different types)
.line
Check the file SPHEREtable.scp and the [SPAWN 8xxx] sections. The codes 8001 on are used for spawn groups. Find the group you like or make a new one. Put the 8xxx number in place of the spawning creature. IT should spawn a creature type from this group.  This funciton is MUCH easier with our new SPHERE Server Hand of God Tool.

[HELP FAQ 19]
Do spawn points create one monster after another or do they spawn only if the original monster is dead?
.line
To get a spawn to generate multiple beasties, you have to set the amount to some number. For example, if you want your spawn to generate 10 creatures, type: .set amount 10 and target your spawn The amount property controls how many spawns this particular spawnpoint can have "alive" at any given point. So if you set it to 10 there will be a maximum of 10 spawns alive (each spawned after waiting the timerperiod (random)). If you don't set the timer (.SET MOREP xx xx 0) the timer will default to 1-20 mins between each new monster spawned. Once a creature dies that creature is subtracted from the total and a new monster is created. If that creature is tamed it is also removed from the spawn count.

The .MULTI command is used with the multi.txt file that comes in the demo CD stuff. It was just a test by Pete to pull in and build multi objects out of real dynamic objects.

Can I design and build my own dungeon?
.line
There are two ways to do this. First you can create a dungeon in some of the unused areas of the map made entirely out of dynamic tiles.Each time a player goes into this region they will ahve to be send all of the items via their internet connection. In complicated areas this can slow down the game significantly.
The other method is to use a tool like WorldForge. Each player must modify their static0.mul and map0.mul files to be able to play this shard.
